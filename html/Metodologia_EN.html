  <center><label class="h5">Conclusion of "SCRUM"</label></center>
  <label>The scrum framework is straightforward on its own, and the rules, artifacts, events, and functions are easy to understand.<br></br> Its semi-prescriptive approach actually helps eliminate ambiguities in the development process, while also offering enough space for companies to introduce their personal touch.<br></br>
    Organizing complex tasks into manageable user stories makes it ideal for difficult projects. In addition, the clear demarcation of functions and planned events ensure that there is transparency and collective ownership throughout the development cycle.<br></br> Quick releases keep the team motivated and users happy, as they can see progress in a short period of time.

  <center><label class="h5">¿What is the process of "SCRUM"?</label></center>
  <label>In Scrum, a project is executed in short time cycles of fixed duration (iterations that are normally 2 weeks, although in some teams they are 3 and up to 4 weeks, maximum limit of feedback from real product and reflection).<br></br>
    Each iteration has to provide a complete result, a final product increment that can be delivered with minimal effort to the customer upon request.<br></br>
    The process starts from the product's prioritized list of objectives / requirements, which acts as a project plan.<br></br>
    In this list, the client (Product Owner) prioritizes the objectives, balancing the value they provide with respect to their cost (which the team estimates considering the Definition of Done) and they are divided into iterations and deliveries.
